To importing the PCB into FreeCAD as a 3D part:
1. Download FreeCAD plugin from https://sourceforge.net/projects/eaglepcb2freecad/?source=typ_redirect
2. The .7zachive will need to be extracted. I used the linux tool [dtrx](https://brettcsmith.org/2007/dtrx/)
3. Follow the instructions within the archive
4. Models need to be downloaded from: https://sourceforge.net/projects/eaglepcb2freecad/files/models/
